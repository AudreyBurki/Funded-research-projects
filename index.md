## Current projects
### Variability in word production
In this project, funded by the DFG-Deutsche Forschungsgemeinshaft (2017-2021 "Variability and its limits in the time course of language production" within the CRC 1287 “Limits of Variability in Language; Cognitive, Grammatical, and Social aspects, 287’900 €) we examine inter- and intra-individual variability in the time course of encoding processes during isolated noun production.

### Determinants of efficient word learning in a second language
In this project, conducted together with Elsa Spinelli (Université Grenoble-Alpes, France) and Pauline Welby (Aix-Marseille Université, France), we examine the roles of orthography and variability in L2 word learning. This project is partly supported by the University of Potsdam International cooperation program (KoUP, 2018, 4427 €)

### Role of talker variability in adult speech processing
This project results from a collaboration between two teams in the SFB 1287 and is funded by the DFG-SFB 1287 (19‘157 €, 2018-2019). Together with Barbara Höhle, Adamantios Gafos, Natalie Boll-Aveytisan, Sylvain Madec, and Marc Hullebus, we examine the role of talker variability in speech processing. 

## Past projects
### Production-perception link
In this project, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (2015-2016, "All speakers are listeners, and vice versa: On the interface between production and comprehension processes" 119’562 CHF) we examine the representations involved in producing and perceiving speech at the phonological and phonetic encoding levels.
